# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
*in its simplicity I feel 8 out of 10; when adding complexities such as "reverse strings" I'm more of a 5 out of 10 but with due practice I can get that up to a 7 or 8.*

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
*I was able to walk through the process in my head and use the terminal to prove the initial code I had was returning true/false statements. I had to take a step back knowing that I had the correct command in word.length but had to hash out the way to make it into an if statement. Having two ends in this code was rather confusing as well but having the color coded syntax was helpful.*

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*Like most everything, I just need to do this over and over until simple tasks and commands are second nature. I'm feeling better everyday about looking at the terminal and atom and understanding what is going on. progress.*

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*I can't begin to imagine how useful iterations are when coding, specifically when they are combined with other methods. I'm sure I'll have plenty of questions along the way but right now I'm ready to be done and get some sleep.*
